The Glow.B Terms of Service reflect the provisions of relevant laws and regulations as follows. These Terms of Service apply to the 'Glow.B' service provided by BYAHT Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company“) through websites and mobile applications and apply to the relationship between members and the Company.

The purpose of these Terms of Service is to stipulate the rights and obligations of the Company and members and other necessary matters regarding the use of services provided by the Company.
Article 2 Definitions
a. Member: A person who signs up to use the Company's services, owns a member account, and has rights and obligations according to these Terms.
b. Member Account: A unique identifier based on the email set by the member to use the Glow.B service.
Notifications and changes from the Company will be sent to the email of the member account, and any disadvantages resulting from registering an email that is unusable or uncheckable by the member are entirely the member's responsibility.
c. Service: The term “Service“ refers to the Glow.B and related services that members can use regardless of the implemented device (including various wired and wireless devices such as PC, TV, portable devices) and the provided form (website, mobile application, etc.).
d. Email Verification: When a member signs up for Glow.B, the Company has an obligation to verify the basic information of the member through an entrusted agency, but it is not credible. Therefore, if a member receives email verification by entering false or fraudulent information, the Company is not legally responsible for the email verification.
Article 3 Effectiveness of the Terms
a. Effective Date: These Terms become effective as soon as the user signs up as a member. They may be amended within the scope not violating related laws, and this will be recognized as effective by notifying through service notices and emails.
b. The member's agreement to these Terms includes consent to check for changes to the Terms by visiting the Glow.B website or mobile application.
c. If a member does not agree to the amended Terms, they may request termination and withdrawal from Glow.B. If they continue to use the service, it is deemed that they agree to the changed Terms.
Article 4 Governing Law
Matters not specified in these Terms shall be governed by the Framework Act on Electronic Commerce, the Act on the Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce, the Act on Regulation of Terms and Conditions, the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, and other related laws and regulations.
Article 5 Membership Registration
a. Those who wish to become members can apply for membership by agreeing to the Terms and completing the email verification and entering the basic information of the member.
b. The information entered by the member is considered to be true. If the information entered by the member is found to be false (e.g., using an alias, not using a real name, entering false information) or suspected to be the information of another person, the Company may request the member to submit evidence and an explanation to confirm the truth. If it is clearly confirmed that the information is false, Glow.B may deprive the member of their rights and refuse the use of the service entirely, and the Company is not responsible for any disadvantages that arise as a result.
c. The Company may differentiate the scope of services based on reasonable criteria such as the member's status, usage period, usage frequency, and service access method, and the member may face restrictions on service use according to these criteria.
d. The Company may reserve or refuse membership approval for those who apply for membership according to the following criteria:
If there is a history of falsifying registration information such as using another person's real-name authentication information or photos
If the applicant has lost membership status due to violations of Glow.B terms and related laws
Those who disturb public order and morals
Those who seek to join Glow.B for profit-seeking purposes
Incompetent persons and quasi-incompetent persons and other similar persons
Those for whom it is difficult to accept use due to the Company's circumstances or who fall under the disqualification reasons for membership.** According to the amended “Resident Registration Act,“ those who illegally use another person's resident registration number may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to 3 years or a fine of up to 10 million won. Related law: Article 37 (Penal Provisions) No. 10 of the Resident Registration Act (Effective Date: April 1, 2009)
e. The time when the membership registration contract is established is based on the time when the Company's approval reaches the applicant.
Article 6 Member Monitoring

Therefore, members who have not completed email verification are in the preparation stage to receive the services prepared by Glow.B and may face restrictions on service use. The Company will assist such members through means such as email.
b. Even after membership registration, the member's profile is monitored, and if necessary for profile management purposes, the content of the profile may be modified or deleted by the review personnel during the review and monitoring process.
c. The Company may restrict the use of a nickname created by a member if it 1) poses a risk of personal information leakage, 2) is antisocial or contrary to public morals, 3) is likely to be mistaken for the Company or its operator, or 4) is not properly entered due to problems in the creation process. The administrator may modify or delete such nicknames.
Article 7 Types and Scope of Services

A separate identity verification fee may be requested from the member according to the method and procedure of identity verification. The Company does not know the accuracy of personal information from the date of identity verification to the current date of service use. It is the member's responsibility to maintain and update their personal information to be current and accurate. The member is responsible for any problems arising from this, and the Company is not liable. The Company may hold the member legally responsible for any internal or external losses resulting from related problems.
f. The Glow.B service provided by the Company includes viewing profiles and providing chat room services on the Glow.B website and mobile application.
g. The responsibility for actions (contact and meetings) between members after connecting through Glow.B lies with the parties involved. Therefore, the actual place and time of contact or meetings should be carefully decided.
h. The Company operates a reporting menu to restrict service use by members who misuse the service or violate the terms or legal restrictions after connecting through Glow.B. Although the responsibility for actions during meetings between members lies with the members involved according to Article 7, Paragraph g, if a report is received and the reported member's actions are judged to cause additional harm to other members, the Company may take follow-up measures such as usage restrictions, withdrawal, permanent deletion of the account, and legal responsibility.
